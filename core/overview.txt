DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS (DSA)
----------------------------------

1. **What is DSA?**
   - Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data for efficient access and modification.
   - Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.
   - Purpose: To write optimized, efficient, and maintainable code.

2. **Why Learn DSA?**
   - Critical for problem-solving and coding interviews.
   - Helps in writing efficient programs with lower time and space complexity.
   - Fundamental for understanding advanced concepts in software development.

3. **Core Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
   - Stacks
   - Queues (Normal, Circular, Priority)
   - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, N-ary Tree)
   - Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted)
   - Hash Tables / Maps / Dictionaries
   - Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
   - Tries

4. **Core Algorithms**
   - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
   - Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Counting, Radix
   - Recursion & Backtracking
   - Dynamic Programming (DP)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Divide & Conquer
   - Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim
   - String Algorithms: KMP, Rabin-Karp, Trie-based matching
   - Bit Manipulation

5. **Complexity Analysis**
   - Time Complexity (Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega)
   - Space Complexity
   - Amortized Analysis

6. **Problem-Solving Patterns**
   - Sliding Window
   - Two Pointers
   - Fast & Slow Pointers
   - Binary Search on Answers
   - Recursion + Memoization
   - Topological Sorting
   - Greedy Choice Patterns
   - Divide & Conquer Strategy

7. **Tips for Practicing DSA**
   - Focus on understanding **logic first**, language second.
   - Solve problems progressively: Easy → Medium → Hard.
   - Track topics and problem types in a structured manner.
   - Maintain a separate “idea.txt” or notes per problem to record approach and patterns.
   - Practice **multiple languages** if you want to improve problem-solving flexibility.

8. **Resources**
   - LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks
   - Books: “Cracking the Coding Interview,” “Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)”
   - YouTube channels: FreeCodeCamp, Tushar Roy, Abdul Bari
